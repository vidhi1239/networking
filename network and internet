                                               NETWORK  & INTERNET 

* NETWORK:-sharing of software and files,info,idea or orders between humans that to related humans is called networking.
       TYPES OF NETWORK:- 
       1] geographical:-
           A] PAN(personal area network)-a network for individual personal use for limited range.
           B] LAN(Local area network) - small area or the range where the info is being shared(related) ex:school,office.
           C]MAN(metropolitian area network)- metropoitian area network connects multipe lan providing high spped connectivity for efficient data-
                                               tranfer and resource sharing. larger thanLAN but smaller than WAN.
                                               EX:company,large collage campus,organization.
        **D] WAN(wide area network)** - large geographical area country or even worldwide ex:internet or W.W.W  . 
        **E] WLAN(wireless local area network) it's a type  of LAN.
     2] By purpose:-  
       **A]VPN(virtual private network)** - A SERVICE THAT encrypts internet traffic and routes it throgh a remote sever masking users IP Address
       **B] SAN(storage area network)** - a high-speed network that provides shared access to block-level data storage devices like disk arrayas to 
                                        multipe servers.


*INTERNET:- collection of many small or big network is called internet.
    ISP( INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER)like jio,airtel,VI
      **IP Address (internet protocol address)** :-To communicate with other computer need an address just like real world works. 
                                                   EX:- 17.172.224.47  
      UNDERSTAND:-17(country).172(state).224(city).47(device/user) 22bits = 4 bytes
             two types of IP :- 1) IPv4 :- version 4
                                   add size:- 32-bits number
                                   formate:- dotted decimal notion(0-255 range)
                                   number of addresses:-(2^32)4.7 billon
                              2) IPv6 :-  verstion 6  
                                  add size 128-bits number
                                  formate:- hexadecimal notation(0-9 ,A-F)
                                  number of address(2^128) 340 trillon
        Types of IP Addresses :-  1) public 2) private 3)static 4) dynamic
                1)public:-you can directly connect to worldwide any person and get in network.
                             To defined one WAN is propere type of  network  to be said to use  public IP Address.
                2)private:-when user and its connected LAN devices can connect throgh it and talk to eachother.
                             LAN uses private IP Addresses.
                3)dynamic:-this type of IP Adds are changeable.In scenario of public IP Adds when user isn't using the internet-
                              the same IP get provided to other users in internet.
                4)static:- Unlike dynamic these are static and fixed non-changeable. even if user isn't using internet at a time -
                             the IP will still be asigned to same user
                          Range of private IP is 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
                                                 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
                                                192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255

      [NOTE]:- In both private and public static and dynamic are available the only diffrence is of range and network-range.
               private & public both can't communicate directly.

            MAC Address(media access control address):- all those devices which are used in network and for communicate(digitally) are asigned 
                                            an address which is MAC address. ex:-0A:22:84:D5:65:V4(TOTAL 6 pairs)
                                             formate:-hexa-decimal(0-255)(A-F)

      UNDERSTAND:-this 6 pairs devices into group of 2 each with 3 pair first group(0A:22:84:) gives info and understaning 
               of organization or manufacturer.
               2nd group(D5:65:V4)gives info about divice like device ID.

*PORTS:-In networking ports is number that determines specific process or sevice running on computer device. ports can be considered door for specific
         room the service which we want to vist.
        - In network to communicate we have 1-65535 so far.
            TYPES OF PORTS:-
              [well-known ports(0-1023)]:-these are most commonly used one and are reserved for common,standardized servies and applications.are 
                                          fundamental to internet functionality,are strictly controlled.
                                    port 80:-used by HTTP for standerd,unencrypted web traffic.
                                    port 443:- used by HTTPS for secure,encrypted web traffic.
                                    port 21:- used by file transfer FTP
                                    port 25:- used  by SMTP for sending emails.
                                    port 53:- used by DNS to translate domain names into IP Addresses.

             [Registered ports(1024-49151)]:- these are assigned for specific applications and services from 3rd-party vendors such as microsoft sql
                                             server.
             [Dynamic(private)ports(49152-65535)]:-used for temporary connections by client applications or private connections.
                                          

                process :- path ---> communication ---> only 1 open port ---> 1-65535 ---> one port at a time

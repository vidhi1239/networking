NETWORK
 network can be from 2 computers to 1000 computers in an area, network installd in small home or office are called SOHO(Small Office/Home Office) let you sheare printer
   documents,pictures,music in that small area network. business and soho provides shared connection of internet.
 local networks are:- small home network,SOHO,medium to large network,wide area network 
  even though soho let you access remotely but size difference refers to number of user(1-10),devices,covered physical area.

DIFFERENT TYPES OF DATA:
  (1) volunteer data :- you know such data is being stored about you
  (2) infered data:-is analysis or conclusion drawn from that observed data cradit card socre.
  (3) observed data :-is data directly captured or measured like networkdevice status,user location.

THE BIT
  Computers use binary codes to represent and interpret letters, numbers and special characters with bits.
  A commonly used code is the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII). With ASCII, each character is represented by eight bits. 
  cuz the human readable lang must be converted into bits for computer CPU to understand.

COMMON METHOD OF DATA TRANSMISSION 
   after data i s connverted into bits it needs to be converted into signals that can be sent across the network media to its destination.
   media is the way in which we transmit the data ex are copper-wire,fiber-optic cable,electromegnetic-waves from air
   signal consist of electrical or optical patterns that are transmitted from one connected device to another. 


THREE COMMON TRANSMITSSION METHODS:-
   Electrical signals - Transmission is achieved by representing data as electrical pulses on copper wire.
   Optical signals - Transmission is achieved by converting the electrical signals into light pulses.
   Wireless signals - Transmission is achieved by using infrared, microwave, or radio waves through the air.

Bendwidth & throghuput 
bandwidth is a capacity of medium that how much data


ISP
all computers connected to network that participate directly in network communication are classified as hosts. hosts can send and receive msg on the network.
>cable and dsl this both are most common method of network connection
cable:-mostly provided by televison service provider internet signels are provide on same coaixel cable internet runs from this cables separates internet digital signal
      from other signal carried on cable and provides connectivity throgh ethernet wires. 
DSL:-
